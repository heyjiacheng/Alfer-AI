The system utilizes a perception pipeline (including depth maps and object tracking) to generate a point cloud. A key component is a sub-goal solver that iteratively refines a path using collision avoidance, reachability constraints (resolved via inverse kinematics), and pose regularization to achieve the desired pose. The path solver employs SciPy for optimization, leveraging dense sampling and linear interpolation. Furthermore, the system incorporates scene collision avoidance, consistency measures, and self-collision avoidance to ensure robust and safe operation.  Essentially, it describes a framework for robot path planning and execution within a constrained environment.",

      "content": "A.5 Implementation Details of Keypoint Proposal\nHerein we describe how keypoint candidates in a scene are generated. For each platform, we use\none of the mounted RGB-D cameras to capture an image of size h \u00d7 w \u00d7 3, depending on which\ncamera has the best holistic view of the environment, as all the keypoints need to be present in the\nfirst frame for the proposed method. Given the captured image, we first use DINOv2 with registers\n(ViT-S14) [5, 137] to extract the patch-wise features Fpatch \u2208 Rh\u2032\u00d7w\u2032\u00d7d. Then we perform bilinear\ninterpolation to upsample the features to the original image size, Finterp \u2208 Rh\u00d7w\u00d7d. To ensure the\nproposal covers all relevant objects in the scene, we extract all masks M = {m1, m2, . . . ,mn} in\nthe scene using Segment Anything (SAM) [132]. Within each maskmi, we apply PCA to project the\nfeatures to three dimensions, FPCA = PCA(Fresized[mi], 3). We find that applying PCA improves\nthe clustering as it often removes details and artifacts related to texture that are not useful for our\ntasks. For each mask j, we cluster the masked features Finterp[mj] using k-means with k = 5 with\nthe Euclidean distance metric. The median centroids of the clusters are used as keypoint candidates,\nwhich are projected to a world coordinate R3 using a calibrated RGB-D camera. Note that we\nalso store which keypoint candidates originate from the same mask, which is later used as part of\nthe rigidity assumption in the optimization loops described in Sec. 3.3. Candidates outside of the\nworkspace bounds are filtered out. To avoid many points cluttered in a small region, we additionally\nuse Mean Shift [138, 139] (with a bandwidth 8cm) to filter out points that are close to each other.\nFinally, the centroids are taken as final candidates. Alternatively, one may develop a pipeline using\nonly segmentation models [132, 140], but we leave comparisons to future work.\nA.6 Querying Vision-Language Model\nAfter we obtain the keypoint candidates, they are overlaid on the captured RGB image with numer-\nical marks {0, . . . , K\u2212 1}. Then the image and the task instruction are fed into a vision-language\nmodel with the prompt described below. The prompt contains only generic instructions with no\nimage-text in-context examples, although a few text-based examples are given to concretely ex-\nplain the proposed method and the expected output from the model. Note that the majority of the\ninvestigated tasks are not discussed in the provided prompt. As a result, the VLM is tasked with\ngenerating ReKep constraints by leveraging its internalized world knowledge.\nFor the experiments conducted in this work, we use GPT-4o [6] as it is one of the latest available\nmodels at the time of the experiments. However, due to rapid advancement in this field, the pipeline\ncan directly benefit from newer models that have better vision-language reasoning. Correspond-\ningly, we observe different models exhibit different behaviors when given the same prompt (with\nthe observation that newer models typically require less fine-grained instructions). As a result, in-\nstead of developing the best prompt for the suite of tasks in this work, we focus on demonstrating\na full-stack pipeline consisting a key component that can be automated and continuously improved\nby future development.\n## Instructions\nSuppose you are controlling a robot to perform manipulation tasks by writing constraint functions in Python.\nThe manipulation task is given as an image of the environment, overlayed with keypoints marked with\ntheir indices, along with a text instruction. The instruction starts with a parenthesis indicating\nwhether the robot has a single arm or is bimanual. For each given task, please perform the following\nsteps:\n- Determine how many stages are involved in the task. Grasping must be an independent stage. Some examples:\n- \"(single-arm) pouring tea from teapot\":\n- 3 stages: \"grasp teapot\", \"align teapot with cup opening\", and \"pour liquid\"\n- \"(single-arm) put red block on top of blue block\":\n- 3 stages: \"grasp red block\", \"align red block on top of blue block\", and \"release red block\"\n- \"(bimanual) fold sleeves to the center\":\n- 2 stages: \"left arm grasps left sleeve and right arm grasps right sleeve\" and \"both arms fold sleeves to\nthe center\"\n- \"(bimanual) fold a jacket\":\n- 3 stages: \"left arm grasps left sleeve and right arm grasps right sleeve\", \"both arms fold sleeves to\nthe center\", and \"grasp the neck with one arm (the other arm stays in place)\", and \"align the neck\nwith the bottom\"\n- For each stage, write two kinds of constraints, \"sub-goal constraints\" and \"path constraints\". The \"sub-goal\nconstraints\" are constraints that must be satisfied **at the end of the stage**, while the \"path\nconstraints\" are constraints that must be satisfied **within the stage**. Some examples:\n- \"(single-arm) pouring liquid from teapot\":\n- \"grasp teapot\" stage:\n- sub-goal constraints: \"align the end-effector with the teapot handle\"\n- path constraints: None\n23",

A collision voxel grid is then calculated\nusing the ESDF and used by other modules in the system. In the sub-goal solver module, we first\ndownsample the gripper points and the grasped object points to have a maximum of 30 points using\nfarthest point sampling. Then we calculate the collision cost using the ESDF voxel grid with linear\ninterpolation with a threshold of 15cm.\nReachability: Since our decision variables are end-effector poses, which may not be always reach-\nable by the robot arms, especially in confined spaces, we need to add a cost term that encourages\nfinding solutions with valid joint configurations. Therefore, we solve an IK problem in each iteration\nof the sub-goal solver using PyBullet [133] and use its residual as a proxy for reachability. We find\nthat this takes around 40% of the time of the full objective function. Alternatively, one may solve\nthe problem in joint space, which would ensure the solution is within the joint limits by enforcing\nthe bounds. We find that this is inefficient with our Python-based implementation as we need to cal-\nculate forward kinematics for a magnitude of more times in the path solver, because the constraints\nare evaluated in the task space. To address this while ensuring efficiency, future works can consider\nusing hardware-accelerated implementations to solve the problems in joint space [58].\nPose Regularization: We also add a small cost that encourages the sub-goal to be close to the\ncurrent end-effector pose.\nConsistency: Since the solver iteratively solves the problem at a high frequency and the noise from\nthe perception pipeline may propagate to the solver, we find it useful to include a consistency cost\nthat encourages the solution to be close to the previous solution.\n(Dual-Arm only) Self-Collision Avoidance: To avoid two arms collide with each other, we compute\nthe pairwise distance between the two point sets, each including the gripper points and grasped\nobject points.\nA.9 Implementation Details of Path Solver\nThe path problems are implemented and solved using SciPy [125]. The number of decision variables\nis calculated based on the distance between the current end-effector pose and the target end-effector\npose. Specifically, we define a fixed step size ( 20cm and 45 degree) and linearly approximate the\ndesired number of \u201cintermediate poses\u201d, which are used as decision variables. As in the sub-goal\nproblem, they are similarly represented using position and Euler angles with the same bounds. For\nthe first solving iteration, the initial guess is chosen to be linear interpolation between the start and\nthe target. We similarly use sampling-based global optimization followed by a gradient-based local\noptimizer in the first iteration and only use local optimizer in subsequent iterations. After we obtain\nthe solution, represented as a number of intermediate poses, we fit a spline using the current pose,\nthe intermediate poses, and the target pose, which are then densely sampled to be executed by the\nrobot.\nIn the objective function, we first unnormalize the decision variables and use piecewise linear in-\nterpolation to obtain a dense sequence of discrete poses to represent the path (referred to as \u201cdense\nsamples\u201d below). A spline interpolation would be aligned with how we postprocess and execute the\nsolution, but we find linear interpolation to be computationally more efficient. Below we discuss the\nindividual cost terms in the objective function.\nConstraint Violation: Similar to that in the sub-goal problem, we check violation of the ReKep\nconstraints for each dense sample along the path and penalize with large weights.\nScene Collision Avoidance: The calculation is similar to the sub-goal problem, except that it is\ncalculated for each dense sample. We ignore the collision calculation with a 5cm radius near the\nstart and the target poses, as this tends to stabilize the solution when solved at a high frequency due\nto various real-world noises. We additionally add a table clearance cost that penalizes the path from\npenetrating the table (or the bottom of the workspace for the wheeled single-arm robot).\n26",
